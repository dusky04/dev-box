Free and open-source software hoped to build a community of empowered users but much of it is now being used to exploit and abuse users, customers, workers, developers, competitors and the society at large. I don’t want to see my work used for any of this. But I still want to give my work as a gift to individuals and well-behaved organisations. And I want to do this with terms that are liberal enough so that they’d also want to contribute back in terms of bug reports, improvements, documentation, and community participation. 

This is why, I was forced to use a variation on what’s known as a “delayed open-source license”:

  - A: If you are using it for a for-profit company that has five or more people:
    - A1: If you’re using this version of the work 3 years or more after its public release: [GPLv3](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) applies
    - A2: If your company donates or pays more than 30,000 USD per year on an ongoing basis to any of these orgs (combined), [GPLv3](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) applies:
        - [Electronic Freedom Foundation](https://www.eff.org/)
        - [Internet Freedom Foundation](https://internetfreedom.in/)
        - [Free Software Foundation](https://fsf.org)
        - [Software Freedom Law Center](https://softwarefreedom.org/)
        - [FOSS United](https://fossunited.org/)
        - [Debian](https://www.debian.org/donations)
        - [Polyglot.Network](https://polyglot.network/)
    - A3: If you have obtained a separate license (25$ / device) for this particular work from the copyright holder (<a href="mailto:nilesh.tr@gmail.com">Nilesh Trivedi</a>), those terms will apply.
    - A4: If none of the above 3 conditions are satisfied, this work is NOT licensed to you and as per copyright law, you don’t have the right to use. copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense and/or sell copies of this work.

  - B: If you are using it for personal use or a for-profit company with less than five people or a non-profit organization or a government body: [GPLv3](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) applies.
